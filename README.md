# ImageToggle
ImageToggle is a browser extension to control the display of images. Using a button on the toolbar, the user can switch between blocking and loading images. The extension is available for Chome, but it does not work in Firefox or Edge.

## Technical implementation
Currently the display and blocking of images is implemented by adding a custom content preference for images.
